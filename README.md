# twitch-plays-guilty-gear-javascript
in order to get started you need the packages that i used, so run

```bash
$ npm install
```

this will install all the libraries from the package json i provided

to run the software, you need to edit the channel name on line 9 to your own name, then you can run with

```bash
$ node .\index.js
```

to exit the script hit ctrl + c

you'll need to change the button processing to whatever you want for your game, or if you play guilty gear you'll need to figure out a way to hard code special moves, good luck!
